# Mutual information power law in Haar and Clifford systems

The main files of relevance here are `haar1.jl` and `clif1.jl`: they contain all of the functions used for Haar and Clifford computation, respectively.  The Haar calculations use the `PastaQ.jl` module, based off of `ITensors`, to perform matrix product state simulations, and the Clifford calculations are done in `QuantumClifford.jl`.
